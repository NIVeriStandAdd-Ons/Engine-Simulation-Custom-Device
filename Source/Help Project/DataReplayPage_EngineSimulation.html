</noscript><h1>Data Replay</h1>
<p class="Body"><strong>Data Replay</strong> configures a data replay component in the referenced FPGA. Data replays define a set of data to load into the FPGA and replay continously for Engine Simulation.</p>
<h2>What do you want to do?</h2>
<h3>Select replay data</h3>
<p class="Body">Select the <strong>Select Data</strong> button to browse for a file containing data to replay and configure the data selection within that file. The file types supported are based upon the data plugins available on your computer. If the file type you wish to load is not available for selection, visit <a href="http://ni.com/dataplugins">NI DataPlugins Download</a> to obtain a data plugin for your file type.</p>
<h3>Configure replay FPGA settings</h3>
<p class="Body">You must specify the size of the FPGA memory used for this data replay with the <strong>FPGA memory size</strong> control. The creator of the LabVIEW FPGA bitfile knows this size, as it was specified during development. Additionally, you must specify what <strong>Simulation Angle Reference</strong> this data replay should use, either Crank Angle (0-360) or Cycle Angle (0-720).</p>
<h3>Adjust data replay voltage levels</h3>
<p class="Body">By default, the data replay will vary in voltage based upon the speed of the engine as a VR sensor does. To view and configure the voltage level variation, select the <strong>voltage</strong> tab. The voltage scaled linearly between the selected voltage at the expected maximum speed and the specified voltage at the expected replay cutoff speed. Replay voltage is zero at any speed below the cutoff speed. Voltage will vary based on the absolute value of engine speed, therefore specified values of engine speed apply for both positive and negative engine speed. Also, when engine speed is negative, by default, voltage will be negated during reverse playback as appropriate for VR sensor simulation. This option is <strong>Negate playback voltage values at negative engine speed</strong> and should be disabled when simulating hall effect sensors. Also, when simulating a hall effect sensor with data replay, set the cutoff speed to 0 and the maximum and cutoff voltages to the same value so voltage does not vary with speed. Additionally, if you are testing an ECU by varying the voltage of replay while keeping a constant speed, you can select <strong>Allow run time override of voltage scaling</strong>. This open creates three new channels under this data replay you can use to change voltage scaling at run time. The equation for replay voltage values is, output value = (slope * (engine speed * 1.5E-7) + intercept) * replay data, where replay data is in full scale range of the analog output. So for example, if you wanted to replay data at 100% of your analog output voltage range, set slope to 0 and intercept to 1.0. For 90%, slope to 0 and intercept to 0.9. </p>
