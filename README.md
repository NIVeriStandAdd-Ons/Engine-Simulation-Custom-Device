## Engine Simulation Custom Device ##

This Add-On is **deprecated** and is no longer updated with new features or bug fixes. Therefore, it is not recommended for use in new projects. A next-generation [Engine Simulation Toolkit](https://github.com/NIVeriStandAdd-Ons/Engine-Simulation-Toolkit-Custom-Device) is available. The new toolkit offers vast improvements to FPGA space utilization, RT performance, and many new features.

**Engine Simulation Custom Device** allows users to test ECUs by simulating an engine.  This includes generating cam and crank signals and capturing output events (such as those for fuel injectors and ignition coils).

### LabVIEW Version ###

LabVIEW 2011

### Built Availability ###

Builds of this IP are available on the [NI VeriStand Add-ons Community](https://decibel.ni.com/content/docs/DOC-19122)

### Quality, Limitations ###

This IP should be considered good quality and mature, but not as high of quality as the Engine Simulation Toolkit which replaces it. This IP has been used worldwide by many customers in deployed applications since early 2011.

### Dependencies ###

Requires the LabVIEW FPGA Advanced Interface tools and Autmotive Engine Simulation Library (AES) which are also both deprecated
